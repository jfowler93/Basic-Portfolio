        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        My name is Joshua Fowler. I am 26 years old and I live in Downtown Orlando, Florida. I graduated UCF in 2015
        with a
        bachelor's degree in human communications. With that degree I worked in radio for 5 years and continue to dabble
        while I bartend and go to school.
        I am currently enrolled in UCF coding bootcamp in order to learn a new skill set and enter a new career field.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have been married to my wife for just 4 months now. We have two beautiful cats together. We also still have a
        roommate, which is similar to having a child.
        Together we enjoy travelling, trying new foods and cocktails, and going to shows.
        <br>
        <br>
        Working in radio has afforded me some cool opportunities. For example, I once shared a stage with Coolio and
        Joey
        Fatone. However, nothing compares to the sense of accomplishment felt when your nephews are marginally impressed
        by
        your collection of Fortnite skins.
