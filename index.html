    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    My name is Joshua Fowler. I am 26 years old and I live in Downtown Orlando, Florida. I graduated UCF in 2015 with a
    bachelor's degree in human communications. With that degree I worked in radio for 5 years and continue to dabble
    while I bartend and go to school.
    I am currently enrolled in UCF coding bootcamp in order to learn a new skill set and enter a new career field.

    I have been married to my wife for just 4 months now. We have two beautiful cats together. We also still have a
    roommate, which is similar to having a child.
    Together we enjoy travelling, trying new foods and cocktails, and going to shows.

    Working in radio has afforded me some cool opportunities. For example, I once shared a stage with Coolio and Joey
    Fatone. However, nothing compares to the sense of accomplishment felt when your nephews are marginally impressed by
    your collection of Fortnite skins.
